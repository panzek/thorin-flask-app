<!-- 
1. Essentially, when our index.html file loads, Flask inherits everything from the base template. 
It then looks for a block element (which we called 'content') and injects that content into it.
And we have a lot less code in our HTML files.
2. This also means that if we make a change, like adding a new root and view, then we don't
have to change it in every file.
3. The word 'content' is just a word that we chose, but we could have called the block
anything, not just 'content'.
