        The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in Bree which kindled Thorin's interest in
        recapturing his long lost family inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the King under the Mountain when Smaug
        came and took it.) Remembering that he had once known an adventurous Hobbit on his travels in the Shire, Gandalf
        decided to add Bilbo to their company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to force. Gandalf
        also believed that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash action. The
        superstitious Dwarves also considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned to leave on other
        business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill into their party.

<!-- 
1. Essentially, when our about.html file loads, Flask inherits everything from the base template. 
It then looks for a block element (which we called 'content') and injects that content into it.
And we have a lot less code in our HTML files.
2. This also means that if we make a change, like adding a new root and view, then we don't
have to change it in every file.
3. The word 'content' is just a word that we chose, but we could have called the block
anything, "head", "footer", or "title", not just 'content'.
